Trauma Patient Oral Presentation Grading Scale
This rubric can be adapted depending on whether the focus is on formative feedback (ongoing learning) or summative assessment (final evaluation). A typical grading scale might range from 1-5 or 1-10, where each number corresponds to a level of competency. Below is a 1-5 scale, with "5" being excellent and "1" being unacceptable.
________________________________________
1. Structure & Organization (1‚Äì5)
Criteria: The ability to deliver a clear, structured presentation, following a logical sequence of trauma management based on the ATLS principles.
‚Ä¢	1: Disorganized, lacks clear structure, unable to distinguish between primary and secondary surveys.
‚Ä¢	2: Minimal structure, confusing transitions, some elements of the primary and secondary surveys are unclear.
‚Ä¢	3: Fair structure, follows a basic sequence but might miss some key elements.
‚Ä¢	4: Good structure, clear transitions between ATLS principles (primary and secondary surveys, management priorities).
‚Ä¢	5: Excellent structure, follows the ATLS guidelines in a systematic, clear, and logical manner.
________________________________________
2. History Taking (1‚Äì5)
Criteria: Gathering and presenting the patient's history (e.g., mechanism of injury, comorbidities, allergies, medications).
‚Ä¢	1: History is incomplete or unclear, missing essential details such as mechanism of injury or patient‚Äôs past medical history.
‚Ä¢	2: Basic history provided, but important elements are overlooked.
‚Ä¢	3: History is generally complete but may lack depth in key areas (e.g., detailed mechanism of injury).
‚Ä¢	4: Comprehensive history, includes key elements (e.g., mechanism, pre-existing conditions, vital information).
‚Ä¢	5: Thorough, well-organized history that is detailed and pertinent to trauma management.
________________________________________
3. Primary Survey (1‚Äì5)
Criteria: Adequate assessment and identification of life-threatening injuries based on the primary survey (ABCDE: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure).
‚Ä¢	1: Fails to identify or prioritize life-threatening conditions, incomplete primary survey.
‚Ä¢	2: Performs primary survey but misses key elements (e.g., airway management or circulation assessment).
‚Ä¢	3: Correctly identifies major life-threatening issues, but lacks depth in some areas.
‚Ä¢	4: Thorough primary survey, identifies all life-threatening injuries and prioritizes appropriately.
‚Ä¢	5: Excellent primary survey, clear rationale for assessment, and immediate action; ensures that all aspects (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure) are addressed comprehensively.
________________________________________
4. Secondary Survey & Further Investigation (1‚Äì5)
Criteria: A detailed approach to identifying less obvious injuries or issues (head-to-toe examination, imaging, lab tests).
‚Ä¢	1: No secondary survey, or inadequate examination.
‚Ä¢	2: Performs secondary survey, but misses critical aspects or doesn‚Äôt follow through with appropriate investigations (e.g., imaging).
‚Ä¢	3: Adequate secondary survey, but lacks some detail in identifying non-obvious injuries.
‚Ä¢	4: Good secondary survey, performs necessary investigations and examination in a clear, methodical way.
‚Ä¢	5: Thorough secondary survey, anticipates and identifies all injuries (both obvious and less obvious), appropriately requests investigations (imaging, lab tests).
________________________________________
5. Treatment & Management Plan (1‚Äì5)
Criteria: Ability to create an evidence-based, timely management plan based on ATLS protocols and trauma guidelines.
‚Ä¢	1: No clear management plan, lacks integration of ATLS principles, or includes unsafe/incorrect interventions.
‚Ä¢	2: Basic management plan but lacks clarity, missing key interventions, or may suggest inappropriate steps.
‚Ä¢	3: Adequate plan, includes most correct steps but lacks detail or prioritization of care.
‚Ä¢	4: Solid management plan, includes timely interventions based on ATLS, though some refinements are possible.
‚Ä¢	5: Comprehensive, evidence-based management plan, demonstrates clear prioritization and execution of ATLS guidelines.
________________________________________
6. Communication Skills (1‚Äì5)
Criteria: Effective communication with the team (verbal clarity, professionalism, and ability to convey essential information).
‚Ä¢	1: Poor communication, disorganized, unclear, and unable to convey critical information.
‚Ä¢	2: Communication is sometimes unclear, missing key elements, or lacks professional tone.
‚Ä¢	3: Clear communication but may miss some critical details or seem hesitant.
‚Ä¢	4: Good communication, clear and professional, conveys most critical information.
‚Ä¢	5: Excellent communication, confident, clear, concise, and professional with no missing critical elements.
________________________________________
7. Clinical Reasoning & Decision Making (1‚Äì5)
Criteria: Ability to reason through the case, demonstrating solid clinical judgment in trauma management (prioritizing interventions, managing complications, and anticipating future needs).
‚Ä¢	1: No evidence of clinical reasoning, fails to prioritize key issues, or makes inappropriate decisions.
‚Ä¢	2: Limited clinical reasoning, decisions are often based on incomplete data or incorrect assumptions.
‚Ä¢	3: Adequate clinical reasoning, mostly appropriate decisions, but lacks depth or foresight in some areas.
‚Ä¢	4: Good clinical reasoning, demonstrates the ability to prioritize and make evidence-based decisions.
‚Ä¢	5: Exceptional clinical reasoning, demonstrates excellent judgment and foresight, prioritizes appropriately and manages anticipated complications effectively.
________________________________________
8. Time Management (1‚Äì5)
Criteria: Ability to deliver an efficient, complete presentation within a reasonable time frame, without unnecessary details or rushing.
‚Ä¢	1: Presentation is overly rushed or significantly over time.
‚Ä¢	2: Takes too long, or important details are omitted due to time constraints.
‚Ä¢	3: Reasonable time management, but either too rushed in some areas or a bit too detailed.
‚Ä¢	4: Good time management, covers all necessary aspects within the time limit.
‚Ä¢	5: Excellent time management, concise, yet thorough presentation, respects time constraints while delivering comprehensive content.
________________________________________
Total Score: 1‚Äì40
‚Ä¢	36‚Äì40: Excellent ‚Äì The student shows a strong command of trauma assessment and management, communicates clearly, and makes well-prioritized decisions.
‚Ä¢	30‚Äì35: Good ‚Äì The student demonstrates competence with only minor areas for improvement in presentation or clinical reasoning.
‚Ä¢	20‚Äì29: Satisfactory ‚Äì The student performs adequately but may have several areas for improvement, especially in structure, clinical reasoning, or communication.
‚Ä¢	Below 20: Needs Improvement ‚Äì Significant deficiencies in multiple areas, requiring additional practice or support."""},
